# Privacy reporting

In 2018 I did a [series of stories](https://elvery.net/drzax/datalife) on how we're tracked by our devices. This issue is only getting bigger and bigger. 

This is a collection of selected reporting and other links on the topic with some notes.

* [Off-Facebook Activity](https://www.facebook.com/off-facebook-activity): This looks like a cynical PR move by Facebook which purports to give users more control over the data collected by Facebook and how it's used. The NYT [wrote it up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/technology/facebook-tool-privacy-apps-websites.html), but fairly uncritically. There is a lot in the content of the announcement to be critical of \(e.g. "Facebook said it initially hoped to provide an option that would let users delete the entire repository of data that the company collected from other sites to improve its targeting of ads. But Facebook said its research showed that people did not want such an all-or-nothing option."\) But it's also worth thinking about the timing as [Techcrunch did](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/) when it pointed out [these emails](https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/exhibit-1-document.pdf) about Cambridge Analytica which Facebook might not want to much attention on.
* The Google Chrome browser is increasingly under fire for privacy issues and has [tried to address the problem](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/). However, their efforts are widely seen as [self-serving](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1).
* Washington Post has done a similar study to \#DataLife but focused on Google Chrome: [Google's web browser has become spyware](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/).
* Washington Post has also done the same with [iPhone apps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/), however, as [pointed out by 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/28/app-trackers/), the reporting doesn't seem entirely objective.
* New York Times did a great job of the visualisation in [a look at web tracking](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html). The reporting used a [framework specifically for privacy research based on Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/OpenWPM). The story is really worth a read.
* In the wake of [a series of smart speaker recordings privacy revelations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/technology/personaltech/alexa-siri-google-assistant-listen.html), Apple is making [changes to Siri privacy](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/improving-siris-privacy-protections/).
* This look at [what happens when you launch a browser for the first](https://twitter.com/jonathansampson/status/1166005813548396549) time is fascinating.
