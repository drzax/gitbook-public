# Reporting

## Investigation

Do you forget [what operators are available in Google searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking)?

OSINT or Open Source Intelligence is really just a long list of, usually internet based, tools and techniques you can use to improve your reporting or dig deeper into a story.

One of the best maintained lists of tools and techniques is [Bellingcat's Online Investigation Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfLPJpRtyq4RFtHJoNpvWQjmGnyVkfE2HYoICKOGguA/edit#).

## Interviewing

There's a thorough list and solid [reviews of audio/interviewing/transcription tools](https://medium.com/journalism-innovation/the-best-new-ways-to-transcribe-c4c342abf172) on Medium. Many of the links below are taken from their list.

The current winner is [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) which does an amazing job of transcription and integrate transcript / audio editing in a way that seems magic.

* Transcribing audio
  * [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com) is a free tool to make manual transcription easier.
  * [Transcribe](http://Transcribe.wreally.com) is a commercial alternative to oTranscribe.
* Auto-transcription
  * [Trint](http://trint.com) is popular and was one of the first services I became aware of.
  * [Temi](http://temi.com) is the option I have most experience with.
  * The IBM Watson [Transcription Demo](https://speech-to-text-demo.mybluemix.net/) is also worth checking out for auto transcription.
  * An open source project that looks promising here is [AutoEdit 2](http://www.autoedit.io/). It offers multiple back end services to actually do the transcription, but it's very buggy at the moment.
  * Other options are: [Happy Scribe](https://www.happyscribe.co/), [Spext](http://spext.co), [Steno](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/steno-live-transcription-and-recording/id1205209916?mt=8), and [Pop Up Archive](https://www.popuparchive.com/).
  * Untested: [Pennamn speech to text](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/penman-speak-your-notes/id1434184098?ls=1)
* Dictation 
  * [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) can now [transcribe your dictation](https://qz.com/work/1087765/how-to-transcribe-audio-fast-and-for-free-using-google-docs-voice-typing/) for free.
* Other Resources 
  * [Olympus TP-8](https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-TP-8-Telephone-Pick-up-Microphone/dp/B007OXMHDE) is an in-ear microphone designed to record phone calls.
* [Otter](http://otter.ai) is an all encompassing audio note-taking app with auto transcription and a generous free tier.
* Call recording
  * [NoNotes.com](https://www.nonotes.com/)
  * [TapeaCall.com](https://www.tapeacall.com/)
  * [Google Voice](http://voice.google.com) \(not available in Australia\)
