# What is this?

A collection of resources that I have used or think look useful. These are mostly focused on tools, resources, components or tutorials that have some relation to storytelling or journalism with a technical bent. That could be anything including visualisation, web development, data manipulation or analysis, investigatory tools and community building.

## Web development

* [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/#/rich-text) is an open source rich-text editor \(not coincidentally, it's the one used by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)\).

## Email

* If you need and email forwarding service, [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/) is one free, open-source service which can help.

## Other guides

As a general rule, this space is focused on specific tools and what they're useful for, but occasionally there is another guide which contains so much useful stuff that it's worth linking to rather than ending up reproducing vast swathes of it here.

* Politico's news apps team has done a great job of documenting their processes with this [Interactive News Developer Guide](https://docs.politicoapps.com/politico-newsroom-developer-guide/).
