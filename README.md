# What is this?

A collection of resources that I have used or think look useful. These are mostly focused on tools, resources, components or tutorials that have some relation to storytelling or journalism with a technical bent. That could be anything including visualisation, web development, data manipulation or analysis, investigatory tools and community building.

Although this is written as though it's for an audience, it's primarily intended as a resource for my own use, so I make no guarantees about keeping it up to date, reorganising it without warning or disappearing things all together.

All that said, I very much welcome any contributions or recommendations you might have, so feel free to propose an edit.

## Web development

* [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org/#/rich-text) is an open source rich-text editor \(not coincidentally, it's the one used by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)\).
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is an excellent source of permissively licensed web fonts to give your digital typeface game a lift. If you're not keen on the Google hosted copies, they have them all in [a convenient GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/fonts) so you can take them from there and self-host
* Keep those dependencies up to date with [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/).
* [Set operations on javascript arrays](https://medium.com/@alvaro.saburido/set-theory-for-arrays-in-es6-eb2f20a61848) is something I seem to find myself needing again and again for which I haven't found a nice library.

### React

* A pretty clear step by step for [getting a React project setup with Webpack and Babel](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658).

## Apps

* [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com) is an interesting app from a Google spreadsheet idea. Might be worth using for the right application.

## Communications

* If you need and email forwarding service, [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/) is one free, open-source service which can help.
* If you need a temporary or alternative phone number, give [Burner](https://www.burnerapp.com/) a go. For a free alternative try [SMSReceiveFree](https://smsreceivefree.com/) â€” though it's number choices are limited and it has what amounts to a public, shared inbox.

## Other guides

As a general rule, this space is focused on specific tools and what they're useful for, but occasionally there is another guide which contains so much useful stuff that it's worth linking to rather than ending up reproducing vast swathes of it here.

* Politico's news apps team has done a great job of documenting their processes with this [Interactive News Developer Guide](https://docs.politicoapps.com/politico-newsroom-developer-guide/).
* You want to be a data-journalist \(i.e. you're a regular journalist who wants to understand how to deal with one of the modern world's most important journalistic source material\)? Read and re-read the [Data Journalism Handbook](https://datajournalismhandbook.org/). 
* The [NYT data training materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZS57_40tWuIB7tV4APVMmTZ-5PXDwX9w).
* ProPublica's [Collaborative Journalism Guide](https://propublica.gitbook.io/collaborative/).
* A [Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom](https://the-field-guide-to-security-training-in-the-newsroom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
