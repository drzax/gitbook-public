# Note-taking and organisation

There are a ton of note taking apps around, these are some I've found that either currently or have used personally. Below there is a list of others I've seen that look interesting, or I want to remember for some reason or another.



* [Bear](https://bear.app/) — I used this every day for years. It's kind of like Evernote (but not quite as _online_). It supports Markdown for formatting.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is like Bear on steriods. It's a note-taking plus a lot more useful stuff like knowledge base, tasks, database, etc type app. It's currently my primary note taking app with the structured data it offers being a big selling point.
* [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) is obviously a tool I like to use for public knowledge base type note taking.
* [Trello](https://trello.com) is, as I use it, a flexible and useful task management app good for both teams and use as a private personal task tracker. I find it less useful now than some other tools like Notion and I didn't enjoy its acquisition by Atlassian.
* [Slash](https://getslash.co/) is a todo list app I tried out for a while. At the time it seemed a bit rough around the edges.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my personal knowledge management (PKM) and note-taking app of choice as of 2022.

| [Time Stripe](https://timestripe.com/) | Recommended by Kai in Dense Discovery. Not sure I love the focus on a 'lifetime view'. I don't need more urgency in my life. |
| [Papyrs](https://papyrs.com/)          | Another wiki/knowledge base style app along the lines of Notion or GitBook                                                   |
