# Organisation and efficiency

### Task management apps

| App | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Trello | Good for organising a long list of tasks into categories, but ultimately too cumbersome for me. |
| Notion | Similar boat to Trello. A good organisational tool, but not working for me. |
| [Slash](https://getslash.co/) | Giving this a go now. Like the idea of focus on a single task and automatic selection of the next task. |
| [Time Stripe](https://timestripe.com/) | Recommended by Kai in Dense Discovery. Not sure I love the focus on a 'lifetime view'. I don't need more urgency in my life. |
| [Papyrs](https://papyrs.com/) | Another wiki/knowledge base style app along the lines of Notion or GitBook |
