  There are a lot of different elements to building a community. Here are some
  tools and tips that might help.

# Community

Whenever I'm asked how to get started in web development, my response is that you need three things. But these things are entirely applicable to learning any new craft.

1. Community – somewhere you can go to ask questions of real people.
2. Vocabulary — you need to start building your vocabulary around terms used.
3. Time — you have to be willing and able to put in the time.

### Email newsletters

Email seems to perpetually be both the last and the next big thing. There are a million ways it could be improved upon, but nobody ever really does because it's pretty good as is.

* Mailchimp
* Campaign Monitor
* Substack
* Mailinator
* Sendgrid
* Mailgun
* Tiny Letter
* Mailblast.io

### Events/Speaking

Attending and speaking at events is a great way to build and participate in the community around journalism and tech.

* Are you stuck writing a talk? [Speaking.io](https://speaking.io) might be helpful.

### Documentation

Documentation is super important and almost always ignored. Sometimes it's because the tools are too hard. New York Times has [leveraged Google Docs](https://github.com/nytimes/library) to fix that.
