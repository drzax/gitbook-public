# Hosting

Finding somewhere to put your thing—whatever it is—can be a pain. I don't want to manage servers if I can help it, so accordingly, I'm a big fan of this movement towards [serverless architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing). Obviously there are still servers, but when someone else is managing them \(often for free if your project is small enough, and usually very affordably if it starts to get bigger\) it feels like there aren't.

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is one of my favourite options for personal projects. It has a generous free option.
* For quick deploys of any old static stuff to the internet [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) and [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) are both convenient options.
* Docker
* Digital Ocean
* Google Cloud Functions
